Despite the proliferation of mobile devices and technologies data collection continues to remain a significant challenge for the effective practice of Applied Behavior Analysis. Tablet/phone-based systems are overly complex and require too much attention during therapy sessions, impacting the delivery of services and quality of data collection. Dynamic programs require adaptations to data collection which are not supported by these systems. In the end teams frequently resort back to pen, paper, and mechanical devices such as hand tally counters. Can we take a different approach to this problem using an IoT pattern? Can we find a way to simplify data collection using simple mechanisms and use the cloud to store the data and classify it after the fact using modern tools and technologies?

## Hackathon Objective

This use case will prove out the path to a viable solution by building a demo/prototype on how data collection might work using IoT technologies and Raspberry Pi type devices. We will be looking to integrate 3D printing into this use case this year and have some expertise on the team in this area and ideally show a clicker working, the system collecting data, and a web interface to see and categorize the data.

## Open Source Objective

We are looking to build out the framework/foundation for developing ABA IoT clickers and data collection mechanisms. We want to have a great starting point so people utilizing/extending this project can get started with meaningful work quickly. That would look like a partner laying down the initial platform as a baseline to run a POC for integrating into their product, or it could be a community project so that partners or people could take an existing “clicker” spec and print it so they could adapt it.
