# Autism Hackathon IoT for ABA Use Case

Despite the proliferation of mobile devices and technologies data collection continues to remain a significant challenge for the effective practice of Applied Behavior Analysis. Tablet/phone-based systems are overly complex and require too much attention during therapy sessions, impacting the delivery of services and quality of data collection. Dynamic programs require adaptations to data collection which are not supported by these systems. In the end teams frequently resort back to pen, paper, and mechanical devices such as hand tally counters.  
• Can we take a different approach to this problem using an IoT pattern? 
• Can we find a way to simplify data collection using simple mechanisms and use the cloud to store the data and classify it after the fact using modern tools and technologies?  
 
This use case will prove out the path to a viable solution by building a demo/prototype on how data collection might work using IoT technologies and Raspberry Pi type devices.

# Next Steps
The use case for the Microsoft Financial Services Autism Hackathon was to build a demo to demostrate how IoT could assist in data collection during a therepy session. As a community project, the focus will be on developing the platform/framework for an IoT system which could be deployed by partners in the space (example: CentralReach), so that new devices could be added easily and plugged into the system.




# Project Details:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
