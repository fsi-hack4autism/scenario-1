# ABA Therapy IOT

A project for the FSI Autism Hackathon, initiatied on March 31st, 2022.

## Introduction

Despite the proliferation of mobile devices and technologies data collection continues to remain a significant challenge for the effective practice of Applied Behavior Analysis. Tablet/phone-based systems are overly complex and require too much attention during therapy sessions, impacting the delivery of services and quality of data collection. Dynamic programs require adaptations to data collection which are not supported by these systems. In the end teams frequently resort back to pen, paper, and mechanical devices such as hand tally counters. Can we take a different approach to this problem using an IoT pattern? Can we find a way to simplify data collection using simple mechanisms and use the cloud to store the data and classify it after the fact using modern tools and technologies?

## Repository Layout

* [/device](device/README.md) - Hardware device + Bluetooth LE specification.
* [/scripts](scripts/) - Testing tools to interface with the device in lieu of a mobile application.
