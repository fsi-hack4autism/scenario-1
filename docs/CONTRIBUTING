# Scenario 1

## Backend

The backend is written in Python and utilizes Azure functions.

### Developing Locally

To easily develop, you should download the
[Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
extension for VS Code.

Manual deployment to Azure can be accomplished using [this Microsoft Learn guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python?pivots=python-mode-configuration)
or [this VS Code guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/deployment).

You can also find the Azure FUnctions Python developer guide
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-python?tabs=asgi%2Capplication-level&pivots=python-mode-configuration).

In order to launch the Functions locally,
you can utilize the debugger for VS Code,
selecting the "Attach to Python Function" option.
However,
to do this you **must be scoped to the `/backend` directory**
in VS Code (e.g., `code ./backend`).
Once done, VS Code should prompt you with
a popup containing the following message:

> Failed to find Python virtual environment ".venv",
which is expected based on the setting
"azureFunctions.pythonVenv".

Select the appropriate option to have VS Code automatically
generate the Python virtual environment for you.
If you miss the prompt or it never appears,
you can manually create the environment using the following.

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

Then run as normal.

This version of Azure Functions requires Python 3.6 to 3.9 to run.
The latest 3.9 version can be downloaded
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/).
